As an Epic Driver, I broke down tasks into manageable units, organized meetings to estimate story points, and created timelines with milestones to track project progression. As the test lead, I attended meetings to discuss test improvements and gathered new requirements for microservices. At Ericsson, I learnt many technical skills, teamwork, and how to utilise a team while also encouraging team members to step outside their comfort zones."
